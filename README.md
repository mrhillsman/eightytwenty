The Pareto Principle states that 20% of the effort can lead to 80% of the results. This principle is applied to language learning, suggesting that by focusing on the most common and essential elements of a language, one can achieve a significant understanding.

Emphasizing the importance of active learning, because just watching tutorials isn't enough. One must practice coding to truly understand a programming language.


The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, shows how quickly we forget information over time.

However, through spaced repetition (reviewing information at increasing intervals), retention can be improved.

To reinforce learning and expand one's knowledge, building projects of increasing difficulty is a great option. This approach helps in revisiting core concepts (spaced repetition) and introduces new concepts gradually.

One doesn't need to know everything about a programming language to be proficient. All languages here will build the following projects:
- Tic Tak Toe
- Class Scheduler
- DFS/BFS Visualizer (depth/breath first search)
- IoT Parking System
- web3

The perspective behind creating these projects is what you have read above. The following languages are planned as of August 2023:
- Python
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (htmx + typescript)
- Dart
- Go
- Java
- C/C++
- Rust
